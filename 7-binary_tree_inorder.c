 * binary_tree_inorder - Goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

 * @func: Pointer to a function to call for each node
 *
 * Description: This function traverses the binary tree using in-order
 * traversal, and for each node, it calls the function pointed to by @func,
 * passing the value in the node as a parameter to the function.
 * If @tree or @func is NULL, the function does nothing.
